Format of chr22.matrix
first line include two numbers: read number and snp number
other lines (each line represent a read): this read include how many fragments, read ID, start covered site, binary fragments, score of each sites  


You can download HAPCUT2, using extractHAIRS code extract binary matrix from alignment

For example: 
/home/yulin/liyanbo/Tools/HapCUT2/build/extractHAIRS --ONT 1 --bam chr22.filter.bam --VCF NA12878_hg38_VCFs/chr22.hg38.vcf --out chr22.matrix --ref chr22.fa 

chr22.filter.bam is alignment between nanopore reads and reference genome
vcf is a set of snp 
chr22.fa is reference genome
